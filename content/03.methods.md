## Methods

### Choice of host-guest systems
In this study, we report the binding thermodynamics of 43 host-guest complexes (Figure @fig:host-guest-pairs and Table @tbl:host-guests) computed using three different force fields. 
The complexes consist of either α- or β-cyclodextrin as host molecules and a series of small molecule guests containing ammonium, carboxylate, or cyclic alcohol functional groups.
The cyclodextrins in the current study are cyclic polymers consisting of six (αCD) or seven (βCD) glucose monomers in the shape of a truncated cone.
The equilibrium constants and standard molar enthalpies of binding for these 43 complexes have been measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [@doi:10.1021/jp962715n].
Calculations on these host-guest systems have been performed previously [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00359], and, as in the prior study, we considered only a single stereoisomer for the 1-methylammonium guests because it was not clear whether a mixture or a pure solution was used in Rekharsky, et al. [@doi:10.1021/jp962715n], and the ΔG difference between each stereoisomer is expected to be < 0.1 kcal/mol [@doi:10.1021/ja9921118].

### Application of force field parameters

We sought to compare force fields directly, and as such, attempted to minimize additional differences between the simulations with each force field.
In all simulations, we applied AM1-BCC [@doi:10.1002/jcc.10128; @doi:10/cvvpkv] partial atomic charges to both the host and guest molecules using the `antechamber` program.
The host charges were calculated using a single glucose molecule with methoxy caps on the O1 and O4 alcohols (Figure @fig:atom-names); each glucose monomer in the cyclodextrin polymer has identical charges.
After removing the capping atoms, the remaining charges were adjusted in small increments to ensure neutrality of the glucose molecule.
Using the entire αCD molecule as an input to `antechamber` results in partial atomic charges that differ by ±0.02 e, compared to using a single monomer, and requires reducing the maximum path length used to determine the equivalence of atomic charges (Figure @fig:charge-schemes).
We used TIP3P water [@doi:10.1063/1.445869] and Joung-Cheatham monovalent ion parameters [@doi:10.1021/jp8001614] in each simulation set.

![Atom names (A) and GAFF atom types (B) for a glucose monomer in αCD shown with two flanking monomers. The remaining three glucose monomers are hidden for clarity.](images/atom-names.png){width="100%" #fig:atom-names}

GAFF v1.7 bond, angle, torsion, and Lennard-Jones parameters were applied using the `tleap` program distributed with AmberTools16.
GAFF v2.1 parameters were applied in an identical manner to the GAFF v1.7 parameters, using the `tleap` program distributed with AmberTools18 and substituting `leaprc.gaff` for `leaprc.gaff2` in the `tleap` input file.

To apply SMIRNOFF99Frosst parameters, we followed a [multistep process](https://github.com/slochower/smirnoff-host-guest/blob/master/02-convert-APR-files.ipynb), beginning with the AMBER-format `.prmtop` and `.inpcrd` GAFF v1.7 files.
The host and guest molecules were parameterized with version 0.0.3 of the Open Force Field Toolkit, which reads molecular coordinates and topologies and creates a serialized repesentation of the molecular system, version 1.0.5 of the SMIRNOFF99Frosst force field, specified in version 1.0 of the SMIRNOFF format.
Once parameterized with SMIRNOFF99Frosst, the topology and coordinates for the host-guest complex were combined with the solvent and ions, which retained their TIP3P water parameters and Joung-Cheatham ion parameters, respectively.
This was accomplished by the `ParmEd` program [@doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9977-1], which enables saving the OpenMM system created by the Open Force Field Toolkit in AMBER-format `.prmtop` and `.inpcrd` files.

### Thermodynamic calculation
We used the attach-pull-release (APR) method, as implemented in the open source package pAPRika version 0.0.3, to calculate absolute binding free energies.
A complete description of the APR method has been provided in the literature [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405; @doi:10.1002/jcc.23398; @doi:10.1007/s10822-014-9735-1; @doi:10.1021/ct5004109].
The attachment and release phases consisted of 15 independent windows.
During the attachment phase, the force constants on the host and guest are scaled by a $\lambda$ parameter that goes from $\lambda = 0$, at which point all restraints are turned off, to $\lambda = 1$, at which point all restraints are at their maximum force constant. 
The $\lambda$ windows are more densely spaced where the force constant is smaller to improve sampling along highly curved regions of the potential of mean force.
Conformational restraints were applied between neighboring glucose units of the cyclodextrin to minimize deformations of the host molecule as the guest molecule is pulled out. 
These restraints were applied along the pseudodihedrals $\ce{{ "{{" }}O5}_n-{C1}_n-{O1}_n-{C4}_{n+1{{ "}}" }}$ and $\ce{{ "{{" }}C1}_n-{O1}_n-{C4}_{n+1}-{C5}_{n+1{{ "}}" }}$ to improve convergence and sampling of the bound state (Figure @fig:atom-names for atom names). 
To further improve sampling of weak-binding guests, we applied a hard wall restraint that confined the guest molecule to within a sphere of 12.3 and 13.5 Å of αCD and βCD, respectively, during the bound state.
The release phase is the conceptual reverse of the attach phase, in which the conformational restraints on the host are gradually turned off ($\lambda =1 \rightarrow 0$) in the absence of the guest.
This explicit release phase is performed once for αCD and once for βCD, as it is independent of guest molecule. 
Finally, an analytic correction is performed to compute the work of moving the guest from the restricted volume enforced by the APR restraints to standard state at 1 M concentration. 

The pulling phase consisted of 45 independent, equally spaced windows. 
During the pulling phase, the $\lambda$ parameter represents the target value of a distance restraint with constant force constant.
This target distance is increased uniformly in 45 increments of 0.4 Å, yielding windows that separate the host and guest by 18 Å over the course of the calculation.

Due to the asymmetry of the primary and secondary alcohols of cyclodextrin (Figure @fig:cavity), and the lack of symmetry of the small molecule guests, there are generally two distinct binding poses that do not interconvert during the simulation timescale.
To account for this effect, we separately compute the binding free energy and enthalpy for each orientation [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405] and combine the results to produce a single value for each host-guest combination using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\Delta G = -RT \ln(\exp(-\beta \Delta G_\text{primary}) + \exp(-\beta \Delta G_\text{secondary})).
\end{equation}

** also provide the corresponding enthalpy equation?**

In this manuscript, we refer to calculations where the guest is pulled out of the primary face of cyclodextrin with a `-p` suffix and calculations whereby the guest is pulled out of the secondary orientation with a `-s` suffix. **I thought p and s refer only to the orientation of the guest, and that the guests were always pulled out the secondary opening.**

Thermodynamic integration was used to compute the binding free energy (ΔG). 
The binding enthalpy (ΔH) was computed as the difference in mean potential energy of the bound state (in the absence of any restraints) and the unbound state (where the guest is held far away from the host, but the conformational restraints on the host are disabled).
The binding entropy (ΔS) was computed by subtraction using ΔG and ΔH.

### Simulations
Simulations were performed with the `pmemd.cuda` module of AMBER 16 (calculations with the GAFF v1.7 force field) and AMBER 18 (calculations with the GAFF v2.1 and SMIRNOFF99Frosst force fields) molecular dynamics software [@url:http://www.ambermd.org]. 
Each window for each system was independently solvated and simulated.
The host-guest simulations using GAFF v1.7 were previously published in Henriksen, *et al.*  [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00359] and are described in additional detail therein. **just a note to go back and make sure we don't say that we did these calculations here. I may have made some erroneous edits to that effect.**
Solvation consisted of 2000 TIP3P waters for the αCD systems and 2210 waters for the βCD systems in an orthorhombic box. 
The host and guest were oriented via non-interacting dummy atoms along the simulation box's long $z$ axis, to allow use of a rectangular periodic box that reduces the amount of solvent required for the calculation.
Each simulation contained enough Na^+^ or Cl^-^ ions to neutralize the host-guest complex and an additional 50 mM NaCl to match the experimental conditions in [@doi:10.1021/jp962715n]. 
In the GAFF simulations, hydrogen mass repartitioning [@doi:10.1021/ct5010406] was used to adjust the mass of hydrogen by a factor of 3, keeping the total molecular weight of each molecule constant and enabling a simulation timestep of 4 fs. **can we say something about why we think this won't mess up GAFF relative to smirnoff?**
Equilibration consisted of 50,000 steps of energy minimization, 100 ps of heating from 0 to 300 K, and then 2000 ps of additional NPT simulation. 
A Langevin thermostat, the Monte Carlo barostat, a nonbonded cutoff of 9 Å and default PME parameters, were used for the NPT simulations.
An isotropic analytic correction to the Lennard-Jones interactions is applied beyond the cutoff distance [@doi:10.1063/1.2799191].
Production NPT simulations were run for a minimum of 2.5 ns and maximum of 50 ns per window, except for the windows used to calculate the enthalpy, which were each simulated for 1 μs. 
In the GAFF v1.7 and GAFF v2.1 simulations, the exact length of each window's simulation was determined by the uncertainty in the work done in each λ window. **GAFF 1.7 was done in prior study, though, right?**
In particular, for restraint energy $U$ in $\lambda$ window $i$, each window (except for the windows used to calculate ΔH) was simulated until the value of $w(\lambda_i)$, defined as

$$
    w(\lambda_i) = 
    \begin{cases}
    \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial \lambda_i} \right)_\text{SEM} \, \frac{\lambda_{i+1}}{2} & i = 0 \\
    \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial \lambda_i} \right)_\text{SEM} \, \frac{\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_{i-1}}{2} & i \in [1, N-1] \\
    \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial \lambda_i} \right)_\text{SEM} \, \frac{1 - \lambda_{i-1}}{2} & i = N \\
    \end{cases}
$$ {#eq:scale_w}

fell below a threshold of 0.02 kcal/mol during the attach phase and 0.1 kcal/mol during the pull phase.
The second term in Equation @eq:scale_w scales the uncertainty in the work in each λ window by the nonuniform spacing of the λ windows.
Excluding the first and last window, the average window length was 11.8 ns and 5.39 ns for GAFF v1.7 and GAFF v2.1 simulations, respectively.
In the interest of simplicity, SMIRNOFF99Frosst production NPT simulations were run for 10 ns per window, except for the first and last window which ran for 1 μs to calculate ΔH. **in the interest of simplicity doesn't really explain it; why not take the simple route for GAFF also? Let's look for a way to tune this text just a bit.**
These procedures led the errors on ΔG and ΔH are of the same magnitude. **Consider deleting the prior sentence.  Or else add some text to make clearer what the point is. Maybe indicate we were targeting uncertainties of e.g. 0.2 kcal/mol and these procedures let us hit them.**

### Statistics
The uncertainty in the work done by each restraint in each simulation window, $\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial \lambda_i} \right)_\text{SEM}$, was estimated using blocking analysis [@doi:10.1063/1.457480], in a manner which has been shown to yield good agreement with uncertainties obtained from independent replicates **cite Niel's paper which looked at this**.
**I wasn't confident the explanation of blocking was adequate; e.g., it didn't mention rerunning with all possible block sizes. Rather than going into the details here, however, I think we can summarize briefly and cite prior work. **
In particular, rather than looking for a plateau in the SEM as the size of the blocks increased, as originally described **Flybjerg**, we instead use the largest standard error of the mean (SEM) obtained for any block size. 
This avoids the requirement of detecting a plateau and yields a more conservative estimate; i.e., a larger SEM.
Then, using Gaussians with the mean and SEM of $\frac{\partial U}{\partial \lambda}$ in each window, new values of $\frac{\partial U}{\partial \lambda}$ were bootstrap sampled for each window 100,000 times and combined to create artificial data for 100,000 notional APR calculations. 
These were integrated across all windows with splines to generate 100,000 estimates of $ΔG^o$. We report the mean and standard deviation of these 100,000 results as the final mean and its SEM.  
The SEM of ΔH was computed from the SEM of the total potential energy in each end point window, estimated using blocking analysis, added in quadrature.
The standard error of the mean of −TΔS was calculated using the uncertainties in ΔG and ΔH added in quadrature.

For each force field, we computed the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean signed error (MSE), the coefficient of determination (R^2^), Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (τ), and the slope and intercept of the linear regressions of the computed properties against the experimental values.
The R^2^ values for the subsets of ligand with each are also reported in the bottom right corner in each graph.
Comparisons with experiment have 43 measurements, for the 43 unique host-guest complexes listed in Table @tbl:host-guests; comparisons between force fields have 86 data points, representing the calculations for the two orientations of the guest, "p" and "s", in the binding site (see above).

The overall RMSE and R^2^ statistics for each comparison are reported as the sample mean estimated from using all the data, with the 95% confidence interval, from bootstrapping, in brackets.
